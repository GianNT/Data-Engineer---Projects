Hello,
I am writing this project to practice my skills in Python, SQL, Airflow.â€¨The idea is:
- I have the website: https://news.ycombinator.com/news which the news and points for each new.
- I will Extract the news having more than 99 points.
- Transform some informations which I need.
- Load them into database in PostgreSQL.
- With the results from SQL, we can create the report, dashboard, send email to others or just the way to sum up the news each day to read.
